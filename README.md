# Helmet Detection System üèçÔ∏è

This project develops a deep learning model using TensorFlow to detect helmets in real-time video feeds, achieving an accuracy of over 92%. Designed to enhance road safety, this system identifies whether motorcycle riders are wearing helmets, aiding traffic management and law enforcement in promoting helmet usage.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect helmets in video streams, achieving real-time performance with high accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation:** Enhanced the training dataset with over 20,000 images, applying techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to improve model robustness against various orientations and lighting conditions.
- **User Interface:** Integrated with Streamlit to create a user-friendly web interface that allows for easy visualization of real-time detections and system analytics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/HelmetDetectionSystem.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
